# My First Python

This repository was created as part of a class I'm taking with Alta3 Research. As the title suggests, I'm just starting with Python.  I'm leaving the template below intact for the sake of time, so no need to read further.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."

## Built With
